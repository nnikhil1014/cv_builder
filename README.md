## About The Project

This is a very basic CV creator, where anyone can add their personal details, click submit, and then get redirected to a CV preview page where they can see their generated CV. It's a simple and beginner-friendly project for practicing React and Redux concepts.

<!-- What I Learned -->
### Learnings

1. Redux: Implemented Redux for store management, learning the flow of data within the app from the store to different components.
2. Component Reusability: Built reusable components to reduce code redundancy.

3. Forward Reference: Learned and implemented the forwardRef hook to enhance custom input components.
